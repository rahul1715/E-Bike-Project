               <h5>Why you should choose e-bikes over e-bicycles ? </h5>
               <p>
                Many of you might think that e-bikes and e-bicycles are same. But they aren’t! Both are different in many ways – Right from their mechanism to their performance.
                </p>
               <p>
                Electric bicycles look like the conventional bicycles. Both have pedals, drive chain, seat post, stem and handlebars. The only difference is that electric bicycles have a motor, controllers and a battery. On the other hand, e-bikes are battery bikes that look like fuel-driven two-wheelers. But they run through electric power and don’t use conventional fuels such as petrol, diesel or gas. They are free from any kind of air or noise pollution. They support green transportation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However e-bicycles are also an eco-friendly and economical option for daily transportation, following are some reasons why you should choose e-bikes over bicycles:
                </p>
                <p>
                    E-bikes are easy to drive<br>
In case of bicycles, you need to pedal it to make it run and it requires too much energy in order to cover longer distance. On the contrary, e-bike comes with accelerator and hence, you don’t need to pedal it. So without any physical strain, you can travel as much as you want.

               <h5>Gearless battery bikes – Ideal for everyday commute </h5>
               <p>
                Don’t worry! You are at right place and we are going to present the solution for you. We have an ECO-FLEET of battery-operated bikes which are highly suitable to all age groups. YObykes’ battery bikes are gearless bikes that come with easily manageable controls. Their key-start feature and light weight make them ideal to use daily, especially for ladies, elders and school-going children as well
                </p>
                <p>

Unlike geared scooters, riding gearless electric scooters doesn’t need any training. No gears, no kick, no fuss! In contrast, they are very easy to ride and maintain as well.
                </p>
                <p>

Nothing can be better than our gearless bikes. Have a look at the list of perks they exhibit:
                </p>
                <li> They are gearless. So easy-to-ride!</li>
                <li>They’re eco-friendly as they don’t use fossil fuels.</li>
                <li>So no pricey fuels and their huge expense!</li>
                <li>  You can charge their battery anywhere anytime. Just carry the charger along with you.</li>
                    <li> They’re light-weight due to absence of heavy components (fuel tank, engine, etc.).</li>
                    <li>  They offer safe speed to drive.</li>

               <h5> Ebike – Ideal for your school-going child</h5>
               <p>
                Do you think that your child needs a vehicle for his/her everyday commute? But are you afraid of his/her safety? What to do? How about gifting him/her an electric scooter designed by Ebike.
            </p>
               <p>
                Using bicycle is really time-consuming and not so convenient. Plus, so much of physical strain leads them to distraction in studies which is obviously not good for them. Another option is taking a public transport but that is again time-consuming and hiring a private cab might cost you so many bucks. You can even think of petrol two-wheelers but for the children between 13 to 18 years of age, driving petrol scooters is illegal and unsafe.

              <h5>How YObykes are zero-pollution electric scooters </h5>
                 <p>
                    As you are already aware, transportation is one of the largest sources of air pollution in the world. This air pollution carries some critical risks for both – environment and human health. That is why it is significant that we now focus on using electric scooters and cars instead of the fuel-driven conventional vehicles because electric scooters and cars don’t emit air pollutants.
                 </p>
                 <p>

                    Ebike are environment-friendly electric scooters unlike the conventional scooters that generate air pollution throughout their life span – during their manufacturing, fueling, vehicle operation and disposal. The gases liberated during these procedures, are very dangerous to Mother Nature as well as human health.
                 </p>
